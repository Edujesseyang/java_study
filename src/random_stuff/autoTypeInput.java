    /* For types like int, double, char, etc. They are primitive type:
        Usage: Used for simple numeric operations, where you need efficient and lightweight processing.
        Memory: Stored directly in the stack (or in registers, depending on the JVM and optimization).
        Cannot be null: int variables cannot hold a null value; they must always contain a valid integer.
       For types like String, Integer, Double, etc. They are wrapper class.
        Usage: Used when you need an object to represent an integer value, such as in collections (e.g., ArrayList<Integer>), 
               or when you need to utilize methods provided by the Integer class.
        Memory: Stored in the heap, as itâ€™s an object, and references to it are stored in the stack.
        Can be null: Integer can hold a null value, which is useful in situations where the absence of a value is meaningful.
